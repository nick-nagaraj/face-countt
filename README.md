# face-countt
Counts the number of head nods and shakes.

# Method of input
A video of the person nodding and shaking should work. However, make sure the subject is nodding with reference to a single reference point chosen at the beginning of the video.

# Disadvantages
1. Requires an Nvidia GPU to run real time.
2. Count is not updated realtime and only generates output at the end of the video stream.
